		Not so sure. Just learned the way to construct componenets and put them together.
		Resource is what needed to be tried.
		
		I already created Attack_move as a customized resource.
		I guess I need to align things to the beat.
		Healthbar system.
		
		Resource can define not only variables, but also methods and signals! Great!

	Todo:
		1. Bossï¼š Kirin is a good choice.
		2. Input System
		3. Dance moves
	After consideration, I believe its better to first construct a normal battle where the boss and player can 
	hurt each other, and then think about aligning the time with beats.




2023/09/27:
	Todo:
		1. Add sound to beats, and other moves (To check input accuracy)
		2. Time stamp
		3. Construct input system (to recognize beats) # Is the input system independent from attack types? Do we need a separate button for entering(exiting) dance state? 
		4. Camera
		5. Create boss  # How many moves does a typical Monster Hunter boss have?
	
	Results:
		1. Event system responds very fast. Finished first try on audio. 
		2. Done. -> Time.get_unix_time_from_system()
		3. 
		4. Simple one added.
		5.
